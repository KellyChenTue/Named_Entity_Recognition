## Named Entity Recognition Practice: FlightTicketSearch


### What is Named Entity Recognition?
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction, and NER seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in the text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, time, etc.

Use cases: (Source from Shashank Gupta[https://dzone.com/articles/named-entity-recognition-applications-and-use-case])
1. Classifying content for news providers/readers
2. Efficient search algorithms
3. Customer support 
4. Research papers
5. ChatBot support

(and so on...)

### Introduction of my NER practice: Flight ticket search 
There are many use cases of NER, I chose one of the tasks to practice.
In `NER_base.py`, I used the library `spaCy` to detect entities of sentences.
Furthermore, with the help of NER techniques, I built a simple ChatBot which can help customers to search for the lowest flight ticket.
As you could see in `FlightTicketSearch.py`.

I used `spaCy` to detect airports and dates from user's input, and then used `Skyscanner Flight Search API` to get the information of certain flights.
